Installation: fork+clone the repo, then run index.html! Easy.

Bronze goal: Basic setup in place, click events working, basic functionality in place. (MVP)

Silver goal: Penalty system actually working

Gold goal: Animations, radio button system as opposed to input?


As a player, I should be able to input my answers and see if I'm correct!
As a player, I should be able to easily track my score to see how well I'm doing.
As a player, I should be able to show my knowledge of video game trivia.
As a player, I should be able to compete with my friends to see who knows the most about random video game trivia.
As an aspiring coder, I can examine the code to better understand the syntax and usage of JS/JQuery.

Process:

Writing questions and setting up variables/event listeners was the first step, and that step is pretty easy. Setting up the questions as an array means the function to pull up questions can pull them up in sequence easily. For scoring, I just created a counter and a function to add 1 to the counter when a question is answered right. Unfortunately, I can't seem to figure out how to implement some kind of penalty system. I thought it would be the same as score adding, just using subtraction.... but I've tried a few methods and nothing seems to be working. Alas.

Things to Work On:
Fixing this penalty system, for one. Also, figuring out how to hide the "Correct!" message when you pull up a new question.
