<!-- Add a brief summary here on what your app does / why you decided to do this app -->

## Installation:
- fork and clone the repository at __________
- open index.html


## User Stories

### Bronze goal (MVP):
- Basic setup in place
- Click events working
- Basic functionality in place

### Silver goal:
- Penalty system actually working

### Gold goal:
- Animations,
- radio button system as opposed to input?

<!-- Shoudn't the user stories below be part of the lists above? -->

- As a player, I should be able to input my answers and see if I'm correct!
- As a player, I should be able to easily track my score to see how well I'm doing.
- As a player, I should be able to show my knowledge of video game trivia.
- As a player, I should be able to compete with my friends to see who knows the most about random video game trivia.
- As an aspiring coder, I can examine the code to better understand the syntax and usage of JS/JQuery.

## Process:

Writing questions and setting up variables/event listeners was the first step, and that step is pretty easy. Setting up the questions as an array means the function to pull up questions can pull them up in sequence easily. For scoring, I just created a counter and a function to add 1 to the counter when a question is answered right. Unfortunately, I can't seem to figure out how to implement some kind of penalty system. I thought it would be the same as score adding, just using subtraction.... but I've tried a few methods and nothing seems to be working. Alas.

<!-- Rework this section to be a little more high level and less about the nuts and bolts of your app.
Include info about how did you plan (wireframing, trello, user stories), problems you ran into, etc. -->


## Things to Work On:
Fixing this penalty system, for one. Also, figuring out how to hide the "Correct!" message when you pull up a new question.
