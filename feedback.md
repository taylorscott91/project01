## Code Comments:

Take a look at my inline code comments in the pull request for specific notes on code.

## Deployment:

> Did you successfully deploy your project to github pages? Is the app's functionality the same deployed as it is locally?

**2: Performing.** Both the deployed app and local version are running smoothly.

## Technical Requirements:

> Did you deliver a project that met all the technical requirements? Given what the class has covered so far, did you build something that was reasonably complex?

**2: Performing.** Your project met the requirements well and displayed good functionality and UI.
I would recommend adding the features you listed as your 'next steps', such as allowing users to
click a button instead of typing in their choice, automatically advancing the questions when
a user answers, implementing your 'penalty' system for wrong answers, and giving the user the
option to 'restart' the game when they finish. Overall, great finished product and a lot of fun to
play though.

## Code Quality:

> Did you follow code style guidance and best practices covered in class, such as spacing, modularity, and semantic naming? Did you comment your code?

**2: Performing.** Your code quality is definitely good. I like that you properly used a document.ready
and a data structure for structuring the questions. Also good abstraction of writing reusable functions.
To bring the code to the next level, I would recommend making your data structure more robust and breaking
some of your larger functions into separate functions that each focus on a smaller task.

## Creativity/Interface:

> Is your user interface easy to use and understand? Does it make sense for the problem you're solving? Does your interface demonstrate creative design?

**2: Performing.** I like that the UI theme was consistent throughout the app. It definitely gave it that
video game feel. Good use of font styling and layout tools like flexbox as well. I would recommend adding some of the UI elements that you listed as next steps.
